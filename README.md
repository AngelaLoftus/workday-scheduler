## User Story
* AS AN employee with a busy schedule
* I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
* SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Criteria for the Project

* This app uses a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN user scrolls down
* THEN user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours
* WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
* THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a time block, the user can enter an event
* WHEN save button for that time block is clicked, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
